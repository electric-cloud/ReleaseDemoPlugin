[] Windows support: Artifact storage location, currently /tmp.
	if (System.getenv().TEMP) { // Windows
		// Save to System.getenv().TEMP
		"Windows"
	} else { // Linux
		// Save to /tmp
		"Linux"
	}
[] Replace runProcedure in artifacts.groovy with jobStep, or transactions.  This will allow for Windows support.  Currently creating artifact file in /tmp.
[] Command line demote doesn't seem to work
[] Why no initial inventory in Release (known issue, may need to run through pipeline once).  Skip non-deploy tasks.
	project "test",{
	  pipeline "test",{
		//formalParameter "normalMode", "1"
		stage "test",{
		  task "test", taskType: "MANUAL", condition: '$[/myProject/normalMode]'
		}
	  }
	}
	Don't use a parameters, prompts and has to be added to release model
	or, is there a seeding API?
[] Better synchronization of demote/promote, artifact creation, deployments.  Currently, relying on wait times.
	- demote.groovy, wait for procedure to complete.  Move the procedure from Default project to plugin project
