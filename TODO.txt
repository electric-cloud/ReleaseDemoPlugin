[] Replace runProcedure in artifacts.groovy with jobStep, or transactions.  This will allow for Windows support.  Currently creating artifact file in /tmp.
[] Command line demote doesn't seem to work
[] Why no initial inventory in Release (known issue, may need to run through pipeline once)
[] Add configuration option
[] Better synchronization of demote/promote, artifact creation, deployments.  Currently, relying on wait times.
	- demote.groovy, wait for procedure to complete.  Move the procedure from Default project to plugin project
